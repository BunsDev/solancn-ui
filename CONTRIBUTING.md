## 🧹 Adding or Contributing a Component

If you want to **add a new component** or **contribute to an existing one**:

1. Navigate to the `app/` folder.

2. Inside `app/`, go to the `components/` folder. Every folder inside `components/` is a component.

3. Create a new folder for your component and add your files.

That’s it! 🎉

## 😟 A Few Guidelines

* Write meaningful commit messages.
* Test your component before submitting a pull request.
* Don't forget to open a pull request from your fork when you're ready!

Happy Coding 💙
