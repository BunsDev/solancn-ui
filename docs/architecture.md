```

#### Component Architecture
- **Component Composition**: Uses a compositional pattern with smaller, focused components
- **Styling Strategy**: Utility-first with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Context API for wallet connection, package management, and UI state
- **Rendering Strategy**: Hybrid approach with Server and Client Components

#### Integration Points
- **Solana Blockchain**: Integration via `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` for wallet connectivity
- **Data Flow**: Unidirectional data flow with React Context for state management
- **API Structure**: Modular API integration points with separation of concerns

#### Key Technical Implementations
1. **Wallet Integration**: Implements wallet connection functionality with real wallet status display and SOL balance
2. **Staking System**: Provides both native and liquid staking options with validator selection
3. **UI Component Library**: Custom implementation following Shadcn UI patterns
4. **Performance Optimization**: Includes performance monitoring and optimized rendering

#### Build and Deployment
- **Build Process**: Next.js build with optimization for production
- **Bundle Analysis**: Configuration for bundle size optimization
- **Deployment Target**: Vercel-optimized deployment

## For Project Managers

### Project Overview

#### Project Purpose
Solancn UI is a modern React component library designed specifically for Solana blockchain applications, offering a comprehensive set of UI components that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

#### Core Functionality
- **Wallet Integration**: Seamless connection to Solana wallets
- **Staking Interface**: User-friendly staking capabilities
- **Portfolio Management**: Tools for tracking assets and investments
- **Transfer & Receive**: Streamlined transaction experience
- **Component Library**: 500+ reusable animated components

#### Project Timeline and Resources

| Phase | Timeline | Key Deliverables | Resources Required |
|-------|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Foundation | Week 1-2 | Project setup, core components | 2 Frontend Engineers |
| Wallet Integration | Week 3 | Wallet connectivity, balance display | 1 Frontend + 1 Blockchain Engineer |
| Staking Features | Week 4-5 | Validator selection, staking interface | 2 Frontend + 1 Blockchain Engineer |
| Portfolio & Transfer | Week 6-7 | Asset tracking, transaction UI | 2 Frontend Engineers |
| Testing & Optimization | Week 8 | Performance tuning, cross-browser testing | 1 QA + 1 Frontend Engineer |

#### Key Performance Indicators
- Component reusability rate (target: 80%+)
- UI performance metrics (target: <1s interaction time)
- Wallet connection success rate (target: 99%+)
- Staking transaction success rate (target: 99.5%+)

#### Risk Assessment
- **Integration Challenges**: Potential issues with wallet providers or blockchain RPC endpoints
- **UI Performance**: Heavy animations may impact performance on lower-end devices
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent functionality across browsers
- **Blockchain Network Changes**: Adaptability to Solana network upgrades

#### Project Dependencies
